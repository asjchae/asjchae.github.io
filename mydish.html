    		<p><strong>USER RESEARCH: Immersive Interviewing</strong><br/><br/>

            We conducted six user visits with various people who cooked for their households. We interviewed:<br/><br/></p>
            <ul>
                <li>A young married couple</li>
                <li>A stay-at-home mom with 4 kids</li>
                <li>The mother and father of 2 teenage girls</li>
                <li>The mother of 2 elementary school kids</li>
                <li>The mother and father of 2 younger children</li>
                <li>A mother of kids who are no longer at home</li>
            </ul>

            <p><br/>After our user visits, we synthesized our observations and found similarities between our users in their habits and values. We concluded that our users'  strongest needs in the kitchen were around saving time and staying organized.<br/></p>

            <p><br/><br/><strong>PERSONAS:</strong><br/>
            The team came up with four personas to represent the people we interviewed.<br/><br/>

            <strong>Hardworking Helen</strong> is a middle-aged working mother of two with a successful career. She values time efficiency in the kitchen and plans her meals each week to create healthy meals for her family.<br/>
            <strong>Spontaneous Shawn</strong> is a college grad who enjoys bringing creativity to his meals. He experiments with new ingredients that he finds at the local grocery store.<br/>
            <strong>Extrovert Elsa</strong> is a suburban housewife and stay-at-home mother of three. She likes to entertain guests and is constantly looking for new recipes to impress her family and friends.<br/>
            <strong>Cooking Couple Carol and Corwin</strong> are middle-aged parents with young children. They both work full time, but they still value having home-cooked meals. They plan their meals around what is already in the refrigerator when they get home from work, and take turns cooking and shopping each week.</p>

    		<p><strong>PRODUCT:</strong></p>

    		<p>We designed a mobile application (prototyped as a <a href="http://mydish.herokuapp.com/">web application</a>) called myDish. The myDish app can be thought of as an <strong>individual digital cookbook</strong> where users are able to take pictures of the meals they cook, record their recipes and any notes they have on their dishes, and upload them to their own personal feed. This application will not only be a <strong>place to store recipes</strong>, it will also be a <strong>source of inspiration</strong> for users who can open the application and scroll through the dishes they've previously made in order to brainstorm what they can cook for their next meal.<br/><br/></p>

    		<p><strong>ROLES AND REFLECTION:</strong><br/><br/>
    		As a team player, I did a little bit of everything for this project. I conducted interviews with our users and led co-design sessions, created wireframes and paper prototypes, and set up the database for our web application prototype.<br/><br/>

            I learned more about formal testing methods through this project through the formal usability study as well as the heuristic evaluation. I found them incredibly useful and based on the feedback we received, I started to think more about what an intuitive user interface looks like. I also learned the value of paper prototypes when it comes to quickly sharing and editing idea concepts.</p>
