        <h2>STREET PERFORMER COACH</h2>
        <p>A new space for reflection and performance planning</p>
        <br/>
        <p><strong>GOAL:</strong> Create a product for <strong>street performers</strong> through user research and a collaborative design process</p>
    </div>

    <div class="desc">
        <div class="research">
            <p><strong>USER RESEARCH: Contextual Inquiry and Semi-structured Interviewing</strong><br/><br/>
            We searched for street performers and buskers in the Boston area. We watched them perform, observed the way they set up and tore down before and after a performance, and met with them in coffee shops to ask them in depth about their experiences with street performing.<br/><br/>

            <strong>PERSONAS:</strong><br/><br/>The team came up with four personas to represent the people we interviewed.<br/><br/>

            <strong>Dreamer Dan</strong> has a strong artistic identity, but is underappreciated by his audience. He struggles to make ends meet  but dreams of having a studio and live shows someday.<br/>
            <strong>Pragmatic Peter</strong> is a successful musician who sees street performance as a means to promote his musical projects, and sells CDs and hands out flyers to interested audience members.<br/>
            <strong>Jammin' Jana</strong> is a music student who street performs with her friends for fun. She loves the social aspect of collaborating with other musicians in the neighborhood.<br/>
            <strong>Counter-Culture Cam</strong> is a rebellious self-taught musician and is more interested in self-expression than fitting in or achieving objective success. She street performs because it gives her more freedom than a retail job.</p>

            <p><strong>PRODUCT:</strong><br/><br/>

            After ideating several ideas and co-designing with our users, we came up with the Street Performer Coach. The Street Performer Coach is a <strong>small device with a camera</strong> that the street performer can put on the ground next to their instrument case. The device records relevant data while the performer is playing, and the street performer can later <strong>review the data on their computer</strong> to reflect and plan for the future.<br/><br/></p>

            <img width="100%" class="projectImage" src="./assets/images/street-performer-mockup-1.jpg">

            <p><br/><br/>Once the device has recorded data for a few performances, it can begin giving <strong>recommendations</strong> to the street performer. The street performer can decide what days to perform based on what days and times have historically been the most successful.<br/><br/></p>

            <img width="100%" class="projectImage" src="./assets/images/street-performer-mockup-2.jpg">

            <p><br/><br/>There is also an earpiece that can be <strong>customized to fit the street performer's personality</strong> that will give them advice during their performance based on the data being captured - for example, it may suggest a song that fits the demographic of the audience, or tell them to change the tempo of their songs based on the mood and the weather.

            <br/><br/>The device is small so as not to distract the audience from the performance, and the earpiece fits neatly into the device when it is not in use, making it a simple addition to the street performer's routine without infringing upon their existing style.<br/><br/></p>

            <p><strong>ROLES AND REFLECTION:</strong><br/><br/>
            I played a heavy role in the <strong>user research and co-design</strong> aspects of the project, and also owned the <strong>user interaction design</strong> for the interface the street performers would use to review the data presented on the computer.<br/><br/>I gained skills in conducting interviews and co-design sessions, and especially learned to put aside any of my personal assumptions. One large assumption I went into this project with was the idea that musicians perform on the streets because they can't get a "real job." By talking to our users, I discovered that most of them choose the busker lifestyle because they value the connections they make with their audience and the freedom of performance over a 9-to-5 job.</p>
