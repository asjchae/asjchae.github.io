    		<p><strong>USER RESEARCH: Immersive Interviewing</strong><br/><br/>
    		We interviewed elementary school teachers with special education classes and visited their classrooms. One teacher said many of her students are homeless or live in shelters, and do not receive the support they need at home. The teachers were interested in exploring ways to provide more support and build stronger relationships with their students.<br/><br/><strong>PERSONA:</strong><br/><br/></p>

    		<p><strong>PRODUCT:</strong><br/><br/>

    		We designed a device that teachers and students can use in the classroom in order to increase communication and engagement. The teacher's device is worn on the wrist and allows the teacher to <strong>send messages to their students</strong> in a matter of seconds. Each student has a <strong>device in a custom case</strong> that sits on their desk. It lights up with the teacher's message when they receive one. At other times, there is a camera attached to each student device that will <strong>record their emotions</strong> throughout the day. The teacher can later <strong>review each student's data</strong> to determine when they were satisfied and when they were upset, which allows them to spot the times when individual students struggle so they can provide more support in the future.</p>

    		<p><strong>ROLES AND REFLECTION:</strong><br/><br/>
    		This project was for a course called Integrated Product Design, and the team was comprised of two Olin students, two Babson students, and one student from the Massachusetts College of Art and Design. I took on the role of project manager for the team and oversaw team communication across the three school campuses, shaped the project direction, and facilitated team meetings. I also played a heavy role in designing the experience the teacher would have while using the device, and built a works-like prototype for a proof of concept of emotion detection.<br/><br/>

            From working with business and industrial design students, I had the opportunity to see several different ways of approaching the same problem. I learned how to better take into consideration materials and sales models when designing a product. Each subteam had to share their different perspectives and compromise when necessary, which was a great experience in working on a cross-disciplinary team.</p>
