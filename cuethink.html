    		<p><strong>THE COMPANY:</strong><br/><br/>
    		<a href="http://www.cuethink.com/">CueThink</a> is an ed-tech startup in Boston creating an innovative iPad application to improve critical thinking skills and math communication of students in grades 4-12. Students are encouraged to think through the steps of problem solving - to understand the problem, plan a solution, solve it, and review what they've done. When they solve the problem, they can record a video of themselves doing their work and talking out loud about what steps they are taking. These videos are then shared with their peers as well as their teacher, and students can then watch videos made by their classmates and leave annotations and likes. This application makes math a social activity for the students and encourages feedback and collaboration.</p>

    		<p><strong>THE INTERNSHIP:</strong><br/><br/>
    		As a part-time intern at a rapid-paced startup, my work varies from week to week. The tasks I am involved with include:</p>
			<ul class="decorated"><br/>
				<li><strong>Product Design:</strong> Creating wireframes informed by the observations on the field. My main project has been to improve the <a href="http://teacher.cuethink.com/">Teacher Dashboard</a> where teachers can set up their classes and assignments and review their students' work.</li>
                <br/>
				<li><strong>Social Media:</strong> Participating in edchats, editing blog posts and other content, and thinking about ways to engage other educators and students</li><br/>
                <li><strong>Quality Assurance:</strong> Testing and debugging the app and teacher dashboard with a focus on ease of use and stability</li>
			</ul>
            <p><br/>If you would like to learn more or see examples of my work, please <a href="mailto:chaeariana@gmail.com">send me an email</a>.</p>

    		<p><strong>REFLECTION:</strong><br/><br/>
    		Working in a small startup environment has allowed me to do a variety of work that I enjoy. The team has a, "You suggest it, you do it" mentality where we are all thinking about ways to improve the product and taking ownership of the direction it takes.<br/><br/>

            It has also been interesting for me because I only work on the work flow and wireframes; another designer polishes the look. While I would like to be able to work on both, as a part-time intern I enjoy focusing more on the interaction than the visuals by taking the feedback we get from our users and thinking about ways to make the product more accessible to them.</p>
