        <p><strong>ABOUT ME:</strong><br/><br/>
        I am a senior at Olin College majoring in Engineering with a Concentration in Human-Centered Software Design. Olin College is a small engineering school in Needham, Massachusetts that places an emphasis on project-based learning and interdisciplinary courses. My experiences here have changed the way I approach learning, and I am excited to start the next chapter of my adventure after graduating in May.<br/><br/>My interests lie at the intersection of software, education, and design. I am currently working part time as a design intern for <a href="./cuethink.html">CueThink</a>, an ed-tech startup in Boston. I also have several pet projects introducing students in K-12 to various aspects of engineering and STEM.<br/><br/>Want to chat?
