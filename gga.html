    		<p><strong>THE INTERNSHIP:</strong><br/><br/>
    		I worked on two projects during my summer internship at GG+A. The first project was for <a href="http://donorask.com/">Donor Ask</a>, a product targeted towards smaller non-profit organizations looking to do prospect research on individuals and receive information on a more limited range of data points than provided by DonorScape. I worked with a partner to conduct market research, create mockups, and work with an external developer to design and build a web and mobile application that gives ask guidance to fundraisers.<br/><br/>For my second project, I worked with a partner to design a prototype for the phase one launch of an analytics web application called Prospect 360 that aggregates key metrics from a client's CRM database and presents them in easy-to-read reports and graphs. We talked to many gift officers and gift officer managers to learn what data would be useful to have, and how the prototype should be organized.<br/><br/>

    		<p><strong>REFLECTION:</strong><br/><br/>
    		Working at GG+A was a change of pace for me, and I learned a lot about the world of philanthropic consulting and fundraising in the non-profit sector. I enjoyed working with members of the analytics team as it gave me the opportunity to think about designing around large amounts of data.<br/><br/>One challenge was that we often did not have access to the firm's clients' data, so we had to fabricate our own. Because neither I nor my intern partner had experience in the field, it was difficult to come up with realistic data sets to design with. We learned to depend on the resources we were given and several subject matter experts who were willing to meet with us, and they guided the multiple iterations of our prototype.</p>
