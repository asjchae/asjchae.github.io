            <b>SUMMARY</b><br>
            Meet the cutest elephant to ever roll around on castor wheels. We designed and built a biologically-inspired toy for fourth graders that mimicked the curl of an elephant's trunk. Our design goal was to build a toy that aesthetically looked like an elephant and allowed the child to control the trunk's movements.

            <b>THE DETAILS</b><br><br>
            Our final elephant toy had three functions. (1) Children were able to ride on its back. (2) The trunk could be curled up and down. (3) The elephant could take in and store water and then shoot it back out.<br><br>

            We learned that children are drawn to toys they can ride on, so we decided to make our elephant large enough to carry a small child. The body of our elephant toy was built from wood, and we assembled the head frame and trunk using laser-cut delrin and flexible plastic. The trunk was threaded using fishing wire, which was then attached to a handle. <img class="desnat" src="assets/images/elephant-prototype.png" width="50%" align="right"> The fishing line would curl as the handle was pulled, creating tension in the fishing line and bending the plastic to move the trunk.<br><br>

            Our toy ended up being a glorified water gun. We ran tubes through the trunk of the elephant and created a pump and tank system. The children would dip the trunk into a bucket of water and use one handle to pump water into the elephant, and then use another handle to shoot the water out.<br><br>

            In order to ensure the safety of the fourth graders riding our toy, we attached long beams to stabilize the elephant before adding castors. The children could then ride the elephant around without the danger of tipping over.<br><br>

            We also designed a game for the fourth graders, providing them with targets on a smaller model of an elephant made of foam. If they were able to accurately shoot water at the targets, they would gain points and succeed in giving the baby elephant a bath. Our elephant was a huge hit with the fourth graders on demo day.

            <b>SUMMARY</b><br>
            We built a website called Sleepstalker that allows users to record the amount of sleep they get each night. Users can track, analyze and share their sleep patterns with their friends and create groups to view statistics.

            <b>THE DETAILS</b><br><br>
            
              Our idea stemmed from a project started by our classmates who were using a Google Spreadsheet to log the number of hours of sleep they got each night. As data was collected, statistics were calculated and graphs were created. This inspired us to create a website that extends the idea of sharing sleep patterns.<br><br>

              Our main goal was to design a website that allowed for individual and group management of sleep pattern data in an aesthetically pleasing way. In Sleepstalker, each user has their own sleep diary where they record the number of hours of sleep they get each night. This data is used to display statistics pertaining to the users' sleeping patterns, both as individuals and in context of groups.<br><br>

              Below are two screenshots from our website. The one on the left shows the user profile page, where users can view their individual sleep trends. The one on the right shows how users can log the number of hours of sleep they get per night.<br><br>
